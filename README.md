# Hey! I'm Meryl.

I am a Full Stack Javascript Developer + [Graphic Designer](https://www.madebymeryl.com) with an emphasis in front-end development. I want to bridge the gap between Designers and Developers to create innovative products and engaging user experiences.

## Projects
* **Jubilant Disco**
    * Back end project matching users together with a compatibility algorithm using their top 10 favorite albums. It accounts for genre, artist, and album matches, as well as where the albums are ranked in their list. It uses an MLab-hosted MongoDB via Mongoose, and NodeJS' Express package, as well as other NPM resources (see package.json for full list of dependencies).
